       /*
          get and navigate() methods
          What are the differencies between get and navigate()
          1. get is easier and faster
          2. navigate has some other functions like back -forward and refresh but get doesn't
          3. navigate uses both string and URL data type Url but get only uses string Url.
          */

        /*
         * What is the difference  between get() and navigate.to ?
         * 1. get() easier to use, used more than navigate()
         * 2. get() a little faster
         * 3. get() takes only string, but navigate.to takes string or URL as parameter
         * 4. navigate has more options: back, forward, refresh
         * ----------------------------------------------------------------
         *What is the difference between close and quit?
         *close() -> closes only current working browser
         *quit() -> closes all browsers.
         *-------------------------------------------------------
         *What is Thread.sleep()?
         *It is used to put some wait.
         *Thread.sleep(5000); puts 5 second ON THIS STEP
         *Thread.sleep is a JAVA wait. It is not a selenium wait.
         *Because this is HARD wait.
         *It means, this will put extra wait EVEN IF WE DON'T NEED
         *We will use selenium waits. They will be DYNAMIC WAIT.
